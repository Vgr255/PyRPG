## 'Sumansa' Backstory (rough summary)

Almost all of my characters are special agents within the ICS, mainly Rank S.
All of the main characters (those who are Rank S) come from a faraway planet known as Sumansa.
All Sumansians have special powers and are born twins (one guy and one girl), and twins have a strong link between them.
They can practically read the minds of each other as well as heal their wounds.
Effectively, when one of them is hurt but the other is fine, energy is drawn from the second and transferred to the wounded one so they can heal.
However, when the energy that needs to be drawn is too great, the link breaks.
Where one would normally die, they live but the link is broken.
A broken link can never be repaired. Victor Morika, then head of the CIA, gathered four of the Sumansians and put them in the S Division.
When Amelia Bater, one of the S-Division agents, is killed, the CIA decides to close to division, blaming it on budget cuts.
The agents back then are unaware of the existence of the link or its purpose.
Jeremy Alexander, Amelia’s twin brother, is extremely touched by the loss of his sister.
Along with Matthew Jotkins and Katelyn Jackson, he moves away from Langley all the way to Madison and start the clandestine ICS agency, simply called FSD, Former S-Division, at the time.
When word spreads that a clandestine, crime-fighting agency has started, many agents of all skill levels from various agencies and
many policemen from various cities came and joined in the FSD, which then became the High-Level Crime Fighters, then shortly after changed to Crime-Fighting Clandestine Agency.
Once it started to spread outside of the USA and across the ocean, it became the International Criminal Tracking and Intervention (IC-TRI),
then the International Criminal Service (ICS). It kept that name ever since. After it gained some stability, Katelyn Jackson, head of the ICS,
created the ACTION-IT (Agencies Council for Tracking and Intervention of National and International Threats), which consists of agents from many agencies
around the globe that contact, meet and decide of actions to take about high-level criminals. It was created as an attempt to give the ICS more power as well as allow better communication between the various agencies.
After the project was launched, she asked Jeremy Alexander to sit at the council, but he refused. After some time, agent Trevor Magnum, former police officer, was appointed as the linking agent.
The ICS had grown bigger, and they had hired many more agents. Gerald Kennedy, living in Madison, was one of them. It was later found he was a Sumansian as well.
After some research, they managed to track his twin sister, Anabella Liakin. She was hired and trained by Jeremy Alexander and his twin sister, Amelia Bater.
Agent Liakin, still being young, needed to attend school. After a while, she called Jeremy in the middle of the night saying her girlfriend had been kidnapped.
They then proceeded to rescue her. After rescuing her, they told her everything, as all agents are not to tell anyone their real lives.
When agent Magnum took his retirement, Liakin became the linking agent of the ACTION-IT and later its vice-president.
When Simon Rookwell, Ghi Martin’s right hand, tries to murder Marisa, he discovers he had just tried to murder his own sister.
Thanks to the link, now broken, she survives. Simon then starts to switch sides and become allied with the ICS.
He spies on Ghi and helps them. When Simon tried to kill her, the only witness was Jeremy, following her.
They were the only ones to know what happened. Jeremy starts training Marisa in secret, to not worry Liakin, who always looks after her.
Alexander later launches the Undercover Underage Agents program, which later changes names to Infiltrated Special Agents Under Civil Cover, or ISAUCC.
The goal of the program was to hire agents with no background as spies for the ICS. Agents searched and hired generally range from 14 to 30 years old, although they accept people from all ages.

*Note: This story can and will change in the future, as the two real people from who Marisa Merkel and Anabella Liakin were inspired from are no longer together. Heavy changes will ensue.*

## Characters

Anabella Liakin |
-----------------
**Agent name**: *Anabella Liakin* |
**Real name**: Classified |
**Codename**: *Liakin* |
**Alias**: *Lia* |
**Birth**: *May 20th, 1995* |
**Death**: Not yet |
**Weapon**: Knives |
**Abilities and backstory**: She can teleport herself and other people (not many, but still) to another place, be it close or far,
as long as she went there once, saw it in a picture/video/whatever or knows exactly where it is (to not end in walls or something).
She wears knives, she doesn't need more as she can simply teleport herself right behind an enemy and stab him.
She is also very strong physically despite not looking like it (she's not very tall and she looks weak physically).
She's the third most important person within the ICS and she's the vice-president of the ACTION-IT.
She was the sixth Rank S Agent, out of eight total. She takes the lead of operations when Jeremy Alexander is absent, on a mission or otherwise unable to perform his duties.
Her real name is still unknown to many people except the S-Rank Agents. She began as an IPT (Important Protection Target), being civil and needed to be protected from people trying to kidnap/kill her.
Operation “Hare”, led by Jeremy Alexander, has for goal to protect herself and Marisa Merkel. Prior to the operation, she was referred to as “CPT-72” (Civilians to Protect and Track, 72nd entry).
During the operation, she was referred to as “Oscar One”, for the ‘O’ letter. After the operation, Alexander, gave her the codename of “Liakin”, which was later used to establish the fake name of Anabella Liakin.

*Note: Most of the above backstory WILL change heavily sometime soon.*

Jeremy Alexander |
------------------
**Agent name**: *Jeremy Alexander* |
**Real name**: Classified |
**Codename**: *Sihnkor* (or *Sihk*, as Amelia calls him) |
**Alias**: *Alex* |
**Birth**: *March 25th, 1996* |
**Death**: *May 28th, 2034* |
**Weapon**: Elketsir, curved magical sword |
**Abilities and backstory**: He can control fire. He wields the Elketsir, a curved sword that is contained in a small bullet.
Once the bullet is fired, thrown or otherwise released, it splits in two and the power contained within it generate the sword.
Once the sword is made, the bullet closes up again and takes place in the middle of the sword (that is, the middle of the would-be circle created from the sword’s arc-shaped blade).
He can also transform into a white eagle. He can cloak himself in fire and disperse into the air as small fire particles to avoid being hit, then merge and become himself again.
He started the ISAUCC program while (secretly) training Marisa, believing that she should not be the only one to profit from his training.
He was right, since many good agents were born thanks to that program. He has a strong sense of leadership and is most often the leader when on a mission.
He refuses to sit in front of a desk when his friends and colleagues are on a mission. He can always be seen on the front lines on any big-scale operation.
He really dislikes when people call him by his first name, and prefers to be called Alex or Alexander. His real name is only known by the other S Agents.

*Again, the parts concerning Liakin and Marisa will change in the future.*

Amelia Bater |
--------------
**Agent name**: *Amelia Bater* |
**Real name**: *Amélie Beauchamp* |
**Codename**: *Amarilla* |
**Alias**: *Am* |
**Birth**: *February 15th, 1992* |
**Death**: *July 8th, 2026* |
**Weapon**: The Twin Sisters, two Adamantium rapiers. |
**Abilities and backstory**: She can control thunder. She fights mainly with her bare hands or leather gloves, but sometimes uses rapiers and short swords.
She can transform into a big grey wolf and run really fast. She usually starts to run and morphs into a wolf as she runs, gaining even more speed.
She often mixes her powers with Alexander to create an even more powerful output. On September 11th, 2001, she got buried under the WTC North Tower while trying to save it.
Her last words before the building collapsed were “I’m sorry”. Eight years later, builders found her body buried under concrete and assumed she was dead, starting to get her out of there.
She woke up shortly after, and took a while to realize she had skipped eight years without realizing it. She headed to the CIA only to find out the S Division was no longer existing and, in fact, officially never existed.
She roamed for about a year, stealing to survive. After a while, she eventually got arrested. While she was being interrogated, she gave away the names of her former comrades.
When hearing the name of Jeremy Alexander, the policemen seemed stunned and went away for a bit. When they came back, they asked her what were her last words.
They let her go, and Alexander picked her up. He was really surprised to see she was still alive. That is when they found out the existence of the link, and the fact theirs was now broken
She does not work undercover unlike the others S-Rank Agents, and instead works as a field agent and leader for the ICS field agents.

Marisa Merkel |
---------------
**Agent name**: *Marisa Merkel* |
**Real name**: Classified |
**Codename**: None |
**Alias**: *Marie* |
**Birth**: *September 29th, 1997* |
**Death**: Not yet |
**Weapon**: Fuhen’na, magical, unalterable katana |
**Abilities and backstory**: She has the ability to heal her own wounds as well as the ones of others.
She can also put an invisible protection cloak on herself or nearby people/people she touches.
She can also put a wider protection screen to protect more people. She wields the Fuhen’na (which means Eternal, Unalterable),
a katana that has the potency to extend the range of her powers as well as enhance them.
The Fuhen’na (Sometimes referred to as the Fenna by Alexander) is a magical katana that only one person can use.
The person who owns it can make it disappear into their body and make it reappear.
When its wielder dies, the first person to take it becomes its new owner.
The katana originally belonged to Jeremy Alexander’s Sumansian father (Not biological father), which he sent on Earth
so it wouldn’t fall in wrong hands, before he was killed. Alexander, hearing voices in his head, finally found it and gained its power.
After he gained it, the voices in his head stopped. During the training of Marisa, he gave her the sword willingly and she wields it ever since.
The sword cannot break and cannot be destroyed. It can pierce through magical protections if enough power is given to it.
Marisa was referred to as “CPT-253” prior to operation “Hare”, as “Oscar 2” during the operation and given the cover name of Marisa Merkel,
which then stuck as a fake name. Only a few agents know her real name.

Matthew Jotkins |
-----------------
**Agent name**: *Matthew Jotkins* |
**Real name**: Classified |
**Codename**: *Malti* |
**Alias**: *Matt* |
**Birth**: *April 3rd, 1995* |
**Death**: *July 8th, 2026* |
**Weapon**: The Omni, a twin-barrelled shotgun |
**Abilities and backstory**: Matthew was recruited in the S Division of the CIA back when he was a policeman.
He’s not really strong but he has sharp reflexes and a fast reaction time as well a good agility, making up for his lack of physical strength.
Ever since he joined he’s had a physical attirance for agent Amelia Bater, but never got around to telling her.
When she got buried in 2001, he refused to give up on the S-Division, deciding that, if they couldn’t be part of the CIA, they might as well be part of their own agency.
Katelyn Jackson and Jeremy Alexander approved, and eventually moved to Madison, Mississippi.
Matthew used his contacts in various agencies to get more agents to join them.
Shortly after, however, he disappears for a while. After seeking him, they deemed it impossible to find or contact him.
They finally meet him again while on a mission, and discover that he is Ghi Martin’s right hand.
He wields a golden-colored curved saber named the Zantetsuken. Jeremy Alexander refuses to kill him and they eventually manage to capture him.
After capturing him, they find out he was being mind-controlled by Ghi Martin to fight his friends.
A while later, they get on a mission to save a civilian being taken hostage. However, as they get there, she is killed, and Matthew instantly falls to the ground with atrocious pain.
They could not get the criminals, and the Zantetsuken had been robbed off Matthew.
They find out later that Emily, the civilian in question, was no other than Matthew’s Sumansian sister.
Thanks to the link, she survived. However, as they were driving her to the agency, she is killed again by a sniper, less than 72 hours after being rescued.
Matthew fell into depression, blaming himself and refusing to go on a mission again.
This stays that way until Amelia Bater comes back, at which point he decides to move on and keeps on fighting.

*This one will also change. A lot of the story will need redoing.*

Katelyn Jackson |
-----------------
**Agent name**: *Katelyn Jackson* |
**Real name**: Unknown |
**Codename**: *Jackson* |
**Alias**: *Kat* |
**Birth**: *July 31st, 1982* |
**Death**: *June 27th, 2026* |
**Weapon**: Magically-created weapons |
**Abilities and backstory**: The former head of the CIA at the time recruited Katelyn (which was not her name back then) to be part of the CIA.
When he finds out that she had special powers, he decided to create the Secret ‘S’ Division, which did not exist anywhere in official files.
They managed to find another person with special powers, Ghi Martin.
They were the sole agents of the S Division and the CIA leader made sure to keep their existence secret.
Being the only two agents in the division, they eventually ended up in a romantic relationship together.
A few years later, they find young child Amélie Beauchamp to have particular powers.
They recruit her despite her young age and train her, giving her the cover name of Amelia Bater.
When, a few years later, Ghi Martin leaves Katelyn and the CIA, she falls in grief.
She eventually overcomes it and became the leader of the S Division, and later the ICS.
Shortly after Ghi’s leave, Victor Morika becomes the new head of the CIA and begins to give more and more assignments to the S Agents.
She has incredible power but prefers to use her intellect to give directions to the agents and command.
She can control the air around her, as such she can fly or make other people fly.
Many agents only get to see her true power on June 27th, 2026, when she and Ghi Martin fight.
She kills him, but because of the link he survives, and then kills Katelyn.
During the chaos that ensues, Marisa Merkel manages to get to Ghi and kills him.
When Katelyn dies, command of the ICS is temporarily given to Jeremy Alexander, before going to Luke Walker (who dies alongside many other agents on May 28th, 2034).

*No, Luke Walker has nothing to do with Star Wars and I did not come up with the name because of it.*

Simon Rookwell |
----------------
**Agent name**: *Simon Rookwell* |
**Real name**: Unknown |
**Codename**: *Intel* |
**Alias**: None |
**Birth**: *November 8th, 1994* |
**Death**: *May 28th, 2034* |
**Weapon**: The Masamune |
**Abilities and backstory**: Simon has the ability to change his appearance at will, as well as his voice, and he can also alter other people’s appearances.
He is also able to read minds and even control them to a certain extent. He was recruited by Ghi Martin as his trainee and became his right hand.
He managed to steal the Masamune, a long and powerful sword. At some point, Ghi orders him to spy on the S Agents, and thus begins to get in a romantic relationship with Amelia Bater.
Alexander, however, dislikes him. He asks Marisa Merkel to spy on him and tell him if there was something fishy about him.
One day, Simon finds out Marisa is spying him, and thus thrusts his sword through her stomach.
He however immediately falls in pain, and Marisa survives. Alexander, who witnessed the scene, eventually comes to the conclusion that Simon and Marisa are Sumansian twins.
He begins to secretly train her, and start the ISAUCC project for young recruits. Simon, on his side, stopped spying on them.
He was no stranger to the Sumansians and decided to start spying on Ghi for the ICS instead.
On June 23rd, 2026, he takes advantage of the fiesta thrown for Ghi’s birthday to escape with a bunch of other people who decided to help Simon and the ICS.
Ghi finds out the day after he had been betrayed, and engages in a full-scale battle against the ICS, many of its ISAUCC agents,
the S Agents, Simon and many of his former mercenaries, which leads to his death.

*Will need some redoing this one too.*

*End of the characters section.*

Not enough yet? Here's some more: The existence of the Sumansian was actually found out quite early by Katelyn and Ghi.
After some research, they found out that the Sumansians landed on Earth because a powerful enemy attacked their planet.
They did not know who, nor how it came to be, but they knew Sumansa was being held and Sumansians were doomed to be extinct.
Since they did not want such a result, they started to study their own DNA and how they could eventually save them.
They found out that half-breeds, resulting from a human and a Sumansian, are not perfect twins.
They had already found the existence of the link, but didn't clearly knew its effects.
They found out that the result of cross-breeding two twins would result in a single child, instead of twins.
That child would not hold the power of one or two, but the combined power of both parents, and even stronger and better.
At that point they had already found out Amelia Bater, and knew her twin had to be somewhere.
For being able to detect her at such a young age, they figured she must be really powerful, and Katelyn began training her.
Ghi went in search of her twin, and found him a few years after.
Katelyn and Ghi had a goal: To make the most powerful Sumansian to save their origin planet.
They decided to separate paths. They both knew they couldn't just talk them into it.
Katelyn made sure Amelia and Jeremy didn't get a lot of time to meet before she got killed.
She made sure to keep Jeremy alive while Amelia was buried. It broke the link but Amelia survived.
Ghi fetched Amelia from the debris and put her in a coma for a few years, keeping her alive.
He finally dropped her back at Ground Zero, making sure she was found, and went away.
He found out from Katelyn that Matthew really liked Amelia.
They tracked back Matthew's sister and killed her, twice, to make Matthew fall into sadness.
It worked, however Matthew still liked Amelia.
In the meanwhile, the ICS as it was found someone who could well be a Sumansian.
Katelyn took the information and classified all of it. She then relayed it to Ghi.
Ghi found and recruited Simon under his wing, and Katelyn found Simon's Sumansian sister. They hired her.
Ghi made sure Simon grew well and eventually took him as his right hand.
He told him to spy on the S Agents, and make sure that Marisa would follow him.
Simon used his powers, which Ghi told him how to use, to trick Alexander into not liking him.
He managed to make him get Marisa to follow him, and made sure to make him follow as well on that day.
He killed Marisa, and found out it was his twin sister.
Katelyn then told Ghi it was successful, and Simon contacted Katelyn a few days later to ask to be a spy for them.
Katelyn accepted after asking him why, and contacted Ghi.
Ghi then briefed Simon about what they were trying to do, which was to get Jeremy Alexander and Amelia Bater to have a child together.
Simon managed to trick Amelia into falling for Alexander, and Alexander into liking Amelia more and more.
They eventually went out, and had a child together in 2021, named Arya Alexander.
Then, Ghi decided to slow down on the attacks and let Arya grow.
Simon, under Ghi and Katelyn's command, began recruiting traitors from within Ghi's mercenaries.
Early in 2026, Ghi, Simon and Katelyn secretly met up in town to plan for the big fight.
Ghi was to throw a birthday party for himself, and Simon was to betray him with all the traitors.
They did so, and Katelyn got a lot of agents to go on the field, along with the S Agents, to fight against them.
They were to both kill each other, making the link unable to work.
However, that did not go as expected. Marisa decided to step in and heal Katelyn, which caused the link to operate.
Katelyn told Marisa to step away, and Ghi, seeing their plans failed, killed Katelyn again.
His power being to gather one's power upon killing them, he generated a strong wind to repel Marisa.
Or so it seemed, but in fact he was purposely making it weak, just enough for her to get close enough.
Ghi knew of her ability to generate her katana from herself through Katelyn, and Marisa killed him with that.
Ghi and Simon had previously set up a locked section in their base, where a lot of people would be hiding and not fighting.
After the fight, Simon went there and unlocked the section, then ordered a sniper to kill Amelia Bater.
He did so, and killed Matthew with her, making everyone else ever so angry and willing to fight.
That was another step in the right direction.
Simon was now the leader of the rebel faction they had saved, and part of the ICS as well.
Nobody knew of his link with the rebel faction, and the fighters knew of the plan.
Simon triggered the large-scale battle on May 28th, 2034, which killed a lot of people.
Marisa, with her powers, could save herself and Arya. Simon died on that day.
On your average day, Arya, Marisa and Gerald get attacked by a team of skilled fighters.
Gerald gets to the brink of death, and begs Arya to kill him, to get his powers.
Marisa was attempting to protect her, but she was weakening, and Arya relunctantly ended up killing Gerald.
She then went into the void with his body, and seeked her father.
She got rescued by a large white eagle, who she knew could not be any other than Jeremy Alexander.
Alexander understood the whole point of Katelyn and Ghi's plan, and took his decision.
The whole Y Team desintegrated, and all their remaining life energy went into Arya.
Arya, now stronger than ever, set back out of the void to find Marisa.
However, Arya did some research, and found out of Katelyn's and Ghi's long-term plan.
She found out that the whole ICS was an excuse for her, and the goal of everything the agents did was for her to get stronger.
She finds out as well that she can only save Sumansa alone. That makes her mad at first, and she cannot resolve to do so.
Eventually, Marisa gives her the Fuhen'na, and after she got it completely, Marisa takes her hand, and thrusts the katana into her stomach.
Arya tries to save her, but the Fuhen'na doesn't forgive, and Marisa dies. She tells her in her last breath to get her powers.
Arya finally harvests Marisa's powers, and, now alone, sets off to the faraway planet of Sumansa, alone yet with everyone.

That was pretty much a good summary of what actually happened. Ghi really is the good guy the whole time, even though he seems corrupted to the bone.
