## PyRPG - a Python text based RPG-like game

Requirements: Python 3.4 or higher

This project is currently done as a side project, done mainly for fun while too bored to code.
Vgr had the idea, and is working on it during his off time.

Python 3.4 is required to run it, because it is built around the use of enums, with the enum module, implemented in 3.4

This doesn't currently do much, and may never do, this is mainly a fun project.
If it DOES do something at some point, well I'll have been wrong once again, with this file as a proof!
